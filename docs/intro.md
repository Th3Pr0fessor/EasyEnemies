# Introduction

# Home

EasyEnemies is an open-source Enemy module that can help you quickly make functional enemies in your games.

## Why choose EasyEnemies?

EasyEnemies aims to cut the amount of time it takes to typically set up enemies in a typical roblox game by having the core foundations of an enemy ai already coded. EveryEnemy registered by the module is stored under the models tag name or model name in a hash table to keep track of either individual enemies or a collection of them. There are a list of settings that you can change to get each enemy to fit your game in the best way possible. In the near future EasyEnemies will be functional with non-humanoid models to aid performance.
